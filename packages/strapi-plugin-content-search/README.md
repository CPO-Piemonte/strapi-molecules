## Features

-**Search by content type entity field** Now you will be able to search through
all content-type fields!

## Component model configuration

Component by default is not searchable. To enable Component to be included in
search or be able to filter by, you've to add option searchable to true in a
configuration json file (`*.settings.json`):

For example for component called `paragraph_component` You need to change
`components/text/paragraph_component.json` by modifying option object:

```diff
{
  "collectionName": "components_text_paragraph_components",
  "info": {
    "name": "paragraph_component",
    "icon": "align-justify"
  },
  "options": {
    +"searchable": true
  },
  "attributes": {
    "body": {
      "type": "text"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

To be able to find model content field, model needs **searchable** property with
true value, then just use:

```
POST /content-search/search
```

with:

```
"_q": "string"
```

Example:

```
{
"_q": "lorem"
}
```

Response:

```
[
    [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "lorem",
            "content": "lorem ipsum",
            "created_at": "2020-07-23T09:48:24.140Z",
            "updated_at": "2020-07-23T09:48:24.140Z",
            "__contentType": "exmaple_content_type"
        }
    ]
]
```
